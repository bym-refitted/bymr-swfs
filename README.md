# BYM Original SWF Code History

This repository contains the source code history of all SWF files found in the file archive dumped by tram98.

This repository should only be updated with commit messages, not actual source code changes.

The purpose of this repository is to perform research on the source code, track changes that were made back then and to understand the codebase more easily.

For each SWF, there is one commit. The encrypted SWF files are not included in the commits because their source code is highly obfuscated.

## Examples
Several commits represent key developments for Backyard Monsters.
1. Inferno
2. Introduction of Map Room 3
3. Introduction of Alliances
4. Anti-Cheat measures
5. Introduction of Town Hall 10
6. and many more.

## Investigating the source code

The best way to take a look at the source is to clone it and perform a git blame using your preferred IDE/Editor.
